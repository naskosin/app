      <h1>Fishing is passion!</h1>
      <p>
        Fish early, and fish late. Many species of fish bite best right at dawn
        and dusk, in ambient sunlight. During the mid-day hours cloud cover can
        make for better fishing, and in direct sunlight (especially during the
        heat of summer) look for areas with shade. Fish often seek out shade
        when itâ€™s hot and sunny and become more active during the cool hours of
        the day, just as you or I might.
